## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails on Vercel

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Click on the failed deployment
   - Read the error logs

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   If it fails locally, fix the errors first

   - ESLint errors → Fix in code
   - TypeScript errors → Check types
   - Missing dependencies → Run `npm install`

### If Changes Don't Appear

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Make sure latest deployment succeeded
   - Check if you're looking at the right URL

2. **Hard Refresh Browser**
   - Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
   - Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)

3. **Check Git**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log
   ```
   Make sure changes were committed and pushed
